# Premise
* The idea of the game is simple: fish of the same color eat each other.
  * (Unlike birds of a feather...)
* You play as two anglerfish, each a different color.
* You gain points by eating fish of the same color.
* You die by eating fish of a different color.

# How to Play
* The red anglerfish is controlled by WASD.
* The blue anglerfish is controlled by the arrow keys.

The camera tracks the red anglerfish.
The blue anglerfish can move in a limited area around the red anglerfish.
